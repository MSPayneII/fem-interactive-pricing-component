Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.


**I completed this challenge with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Build out this interactive pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size (mobile, tablet, laptop/desktop)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)

* Chrome does not support slider progress bar formatting. To see full formatting for slider bar css, view in firefox. 

### Page view and pricing totals

Js event listeners are used to update the page view ranges and price totals.

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

- Mobile view will see "-25%"
- Tablet and up will see "25% discount"
